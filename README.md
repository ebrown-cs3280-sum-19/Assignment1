# Assignment Instructions #

CS 3280 assignment requirement files. I will be adding instructions and any necessary files for assignments to this repo throughout the semester.

## Turning In Assignments ##

All assignments will be turned in using github.

Workflow for turning in assignments:

1. Create a new **private repo** in github for the assignment. You can name it whatever you like but I recommend something like: `cs3280Assignment1`
2. Add `ethanbrown3` as a collaborator to that repo
   1. ![settings](images/repo-settings.png)
   2. ![collaborators](images/repo-collaborators.png)
   3. ![add collaborator](images/repo-add-collaborator.png)
3. I recommend adding a [c# .gitignore file](https://www.gitignore.io/api/csharp)
4. Make frequent commits as you work on the assignment (this helps me track your progress and offer feedback)
5. When the assignment is completed, copy the link to the repo and submit it for the assignment submission

> **WARNING:** Please don't forget to make your repo private. If it is not private I won't grade it. We'll talk about public repos and open source projects for the final project.
